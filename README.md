# hello-world-game-of-life
This is a VERY SIMPLE version of a game that is (kind of) like the game of life. 

There are only two rules: 
- If a block is surrounded by four blocks then eliminate those blocks.
- If a block is surrounded by no blocks, then randomly create a block either above, below, to the right or to the left.

That's it! :-)
